This is a web app to try out a sign-up and on-boarding flow for a new user to a hypothetical app. The repo uses `yarn workspaces` to organize the code. There are two packages `frontend` and `backend`. The `frontend` package contains a `react` app which uses `snowpack` as its build tool. The `backend` package contains an `express` app that Exposes a REST API that is consumed by the frontend.
